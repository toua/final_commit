<td><p>I am currently a junior majoring in Design. I create illustrations that revolve around nature such as fauna, flora and the human body. I mostly work with traditional medium because I find this to be my strongest medium to work with like watercolor and pencils. I appreciate the handmade quality of working with traditional mediums due to how it has influenced my work. Nature is something that had interested me as a kid growing up as I played in my family’s garden and was always surrounded by the woods. That’s what leads me to how I produce my own artistic style.
My inspiration tends to come from natural environments or my imagination, and helps me to create thumbnails sketches or ideas. Sketching/ex- perimenting with mediums also helps me see ways I can arrange what to be put on a page or what materi- al I would use for the final piece.
Coming to Minneapolis College of Art and Design, my initial intention was animation because growing up I loved all of the Disney animations and the motion graphics that went along with them. After taking Intro to Animation, I realized the repetitious nature of animation and took up illustration because I find that I can tell a better narrative with a stand-alone piece. I can convey my story through the process of ideating multiple directions, and then choosing one the final piece.
As an Illustrator I am always improving to find my own style. For example, I enjoy drawing females or animals with natural phenomenon such as plants, animals, bones, and etc. to convey the aspect of nature in life or aspect within the world that revolves around nature. My portfolio currently lacks digital illustrations, which is something I am currently trying to improve. I am also working towards drawing more men than women and girls, in orders to have an equally proportions of understanding both figures. I would like to balance out my portfolio with both digital and traditional art, and I’d even like to explore new techniques with the way I paint and draw. I have been focusing in those areas in order to further my skills.
With the time I have left at MCAD, I would like to bring my digital skills up to the level of my tradi- tional techniques, and find a style that I’m happy with calling “my own”. In the future, I would like to work
in concept art or character design through the highly developed technical skills acquired from school. Also, working in pattern design like giftwraps and wallpaper has been an interest of mine after taking digital illus- tration. Another interest as of lately is experimenting with typography.</p></td>
